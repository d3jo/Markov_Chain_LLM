# LLM using Markov Chain algorithm

This model uses a probablistic features of a sequence of words and predicts the  sequence of words that occurs often and creates sentences out of it.

In other words, this model will collect all the words from a book and analyzes which pair of words show up frequently and based on the probability of those occurences,
it will create random sentences.

Although the recreated stories may not align as a logical story, it uses a complex algorithm that predicts which word should come next.
